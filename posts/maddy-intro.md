Meet Maddy, the trailblazing singer-songwriter who’s lighting the fuse for Timeless Records. With a sound that fuses classic rock soul and modern indie authenticity, Maddy has already proven herself not only as a vocalist, but as a producer, arranger, and creative force to be reckoned with.

Her debut single marks more than a release — it's a statement. Written, recorded, and mixed entirely by Maddy herself, it’s a raw and refined example of what we call Indie 2.0: artists owning their process, embracing the tech, and telling real stories.

Maddy’s music is infused with emotion and experimentation. Inspired by legends like Queen and Amy Winehouse, yet shaped by the current of bedroom pop and poetic lyricism, her work is immediately familiar — and completely her own.

We couldn’t be more excited to have her as the first artist representing the label. This is just the beginning.
